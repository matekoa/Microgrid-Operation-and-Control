# Microgrid Operation and Control

### Software Used: DIgSILENT PowerFactory
### Concepts Studied:
- Load Flow Analysis
- Short-Circuit (Bolted) Fault Analysis
- Economic Dispatch
- Wind Energy Integration

## Objectives
To understand the concept of a micro-grid and its operation.
To analyze the behavior of a grid under different conditions.

## Microgrid was studied under the following conditions
**1. Islanded micro-grid without renewable power sources**

**2. micro-grid connected to the main grid without renewable power sources**

**3. Islanded micro-grid with renewable power sources**
